# Red-Wine-Quality-Analysis

## Overview
This project explores the quality of red wine using various statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms in R. 

## Key Tools and Libraries
- R
- Tidyverse
- Ggplot2
- Dplyr
- Modelr
- RStudio

## Project Highlights
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on red wine quality, emphasizing key variables such as pH, residual sugar, and fixed acidity.
- Created insightful visualizations using Ggplot2, including a bar chart illustrating the distribution of wine quality categories.
- Implemented Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to model wine quality, with predictions and residuals evaluated.
- Analyzed the MLR model, revealing a positive relationship between alcohol content and predicted quality.
- Initiated a Regression Random Forest Model with the randomForest package, utilizing 500 trees for accurate quality assessment.
